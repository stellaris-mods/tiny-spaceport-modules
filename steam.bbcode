Compatible with 1080/1440 addons.

[b][i]I do not actually play Stellaris, I only make mods. That is how I have fun. Since I do not actually play, I have no idea what would be best for you. Please give me written feedback.[/i][/b]

Compatible with Riots Spaceport Modules Extended that adds literally tons of spaceport modules.
